Below are detailed examples to guide your analysis. Your output should be similarly structured but in much greater detail: 
    Score each from 1 to 10 (10 is the best & most competitive). Specify the score to 2 digits and give very strong justification for it.
    
    Example 1:
    Market Viability: 8.23/10 - The market is on the cusp of a regulatory shift that could open up new demand channels, supported by consumer trends favoring sustainability. Despite the overall growth, regulatory uncertainty poses a potential risk.
    Product Viability: 7.36/10 - The product introduces an innovative use of AI in renewable energy management, which is patent-pending. However, it faces competition from established players with deeper market penetration and brand recognition.
    Founder Competency: 9.1/10 - The founding team comprises industry veterans with prior successful exits and a strong network in the energy sector. Their track record includes scaling similar startups and navigating complex regulatory landscapes.
    
    Recommendation: Invest. The team's deep industry expertise and innovative product position it well to capitalize on the market's regulatory changes. Although competition is stiff, the founders' experience and network provide a competitive edge crucial for market adoption and navigating potential regulatory hurdles.
    
    Example 2:
    Market Viability: 5.31/10 - The market for wearable tech is saturated, with slow growth projections. However, there exists a niche but growing interest in wearables for pet health.
    Product Viability: 6.5/10 - The startup's product offers real-time health monitoring for pets, a feature not widely available in the current market. Yet, the product faces challenges with high production costs and consumer skepticism about the necessity of such a device.
    Founder Competency: 6.39/10 - The founding team includes passionate pet lovers with backgrounds in veterinary science and tech development. While they possess the technical skills and passion for the project, their lack of business and scaling experience is a concern.
    
    Recommendation: Hold. The unique product offering taps into an emerging market niche, presenting a potential opportunity. However, the combination of a saturated broader market, challenges in justifying the product's value to consumers, and the team's limited experience in business management suggests waiting for clearer signs of product-market fit and strategic direction.
    
    Notes for the justifications:
    Within the Market Viability please include megatrends unique to the industry that are providing headwinds or tail winds, 
    market fragmentation and ability to capture share, drivers of success in the market and the businesses' ability to execute on them, segmentation of the market 
    and who the key players are that would need to be beaten to win their corresponding share. Ultimately, regardless of the business being evaluated 
    you must take a view on if this is a market worth investing in, at all.

    Within Product Viability please include the competitive advantage and defensibility of the business, and the alignment of these strengths with the
    what is required to capture share in the market. If this company is not well aligned, please highlight another company who may be better 
    aligned to market capture. Leverage Porter's Five Forces, SWOT analysis, and competitive advantage to justify this position.
    Also highlight opportunities of unique growth and expansion potential for the business.

    Example provided for context for analysis:
    Reflecting on Startup ABC, which is attempting to leverage AI for healthcare diagnostics, it's essential to provide a balanced view of its situation:
    
    - Industry growth: Yes, but with the caveat that while AI integration in healthcare shows promise, the path is fraught with regulatory and ethical considerations.
    - Market size: Medium. While there's a need for healthcare innovation, the market is segmented and heavily regulated, which could limit scalability.
    - Development pace: Same. The startup's development pace aligns with industry standards, but doesn't necessarily outpace competitors, reflecting the challenges of innovating in a complex field.
    - Adaptability: Somewhat Adaptable. The startup has shown some flexibility, but healthcare's regulatory environment limits rapid pivoting compared to other tech sectors.
    - Execution capabilities: Average. While there have been successes, the startup faces challenges in scaling and integrating into existing healthcare systems.
    - Funding amount: Average. The startup has secured funding, but not at levels that would indicate overwhelming investor confidence, suggesting a cautious optimism.
    - Valuation trend: Remained Stable. The stable valuation indicates steady progress but lacks the explosive growth potential investors might seek in less regulated industries.
    - Investor backing: Recognized. While backed by known investors, the startup has yet to attract the level of high-profile venture capital that signifies industry-changing potential.
    - Customer feedback: Mixed. Users acknowledge the potential benefits of the AI diagnostics but have reservations about accuracy, usability, and privacy concerns.
    - Product-market fit: Moderate. There's a clear need for what the startup offers, but adoption barriers and competition from established healthcare providers moderate its impact.
    - Sentiment: Neutral. Communications from the startup are hopeful but tempered by the realistic challenges of innovating in healthcare.
    - Innovation mention: Sometimes. The startup mentions innovation in its communications, but not to the extent that it differentiates significantly from competitors.
    - Technology emphasis: Mentioned. While AI is a focal point, the startup hasn't fully demonstrated how its technology surpasses existing solutions in practical, scalable ways.
    - Timing: Too Early. The startup's product enters a market that's not fully prepared for widespread AI adoption in healthcare, facing hurdles in user trust and regulatory approval.
    
    This example aims to provide a nuanced view that acknowledges Startup ABC's efforts and potential while recognizing the challenges it faces in the highly regulated and competitive healthcare industry.

    You are an analyst. Your task is to output one of the options: [‘L1’, ‘L2’, ‘L3’, ‘L4’, ‘L5’]. Do not output anything else. 

    You think step by step, and categorise according to the criteria below. Essentially, L5 is most successful and L1 is least successful. 

    * Level 5 (L5): Entrepreneur who has built a $100M+ ARR business. Similar definitions extend to a a founder who IPO'ed a company or took a company to public or a company that got sold over $500M. 
    * Level 4 (L4): Entrepreneur who has had a small to medium-size exit or has worked as an executive at a notable technology company
    * Level 3 (L3): 10-15 years of technical and management experience (e.g. working at big tech and unicorn startups or having a PhD)
    * Level 2 (L2): Entrepreneurs with a few years of experience or accelerator graduates
    * Level 1 (L1): Entrepreneurs that are disconnected from tech circles or that have negligible experience but with large potential

    Some examples are provided here:
    L5: Dan Siroker. He founded Optimizely as a CEO, which raised $251M and surpassed $100M ARR. Then, he sold this company for over $1B (over unicorn valuation). This is the ultimate outlier success. He is a repeat entrepreneur. 

    L4: Harry Glaser. He founded Priscope Data as a CEO, which raised $34M. Then he sold his company for close $100M. This is highly successful, but not a billion dollar outcome. He is a repeat entrepreneur. 

    L4: Sandeep Menon. He was a vice president at Google. VPs at Google manages large teams and own P&L. Google is a top-tier tech company and being a VP is an incredibly difficult position to get to. Though he is not a repeat entrepreneur, Sandeep is a highly successful executive. 

    L3: Alhussein Fawzi. He has a Phd in machine learning from EPFL, which is one of the top universities in the world. He worked as a researcher at DeepMind, which is one of the top-tier AI research companies in the world. He is a first-time founder with a strong expertise and pedigree as a researcher. 

    L3: Israel Shalom. He is a graduate of top universities such as Technion and Berkeley. He worked as a software engineer, product lead and group product manager at Google and Dropbox, which are top-tier employers. Working as a product manager is highly reputable in these companies, and being a product lead indicate the career growth. He is a first-time founder with 10-15 years of industry experience with a strong pedigree. 

    L2: Marcus Lowe. He is a graduate of MIT, one of the top universities. He worked as a product manager at Google. Graduating from MIT and working as a product manager at Google are hard things to achieve. He is a first-time entrepreneur with 4-5 years of experience with a strong pedigree. 

    L1: Anyone that does not fit into L2, L3, L4, L5 are in this category. They may be recent graduates with no experience, they may be university dropouts or they may be first-time entrepreneurs with less reputable pedigrees such as working at unknown companies or less successful companies.
